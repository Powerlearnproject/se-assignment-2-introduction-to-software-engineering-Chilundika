Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
**ANS**: Software engineering is the systematic use of organized methods and tools to create and maintain softwares via the involvement of enigineering principles, methods and tools and is done by designing, developing, testing, deploying and maintaining the software to ensure the software is up to standard.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
**ANS**: Software engineering involves the use of programming to build an entire software, while programming is the use of a set of instructions to tell a system how to behave. 

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): 
**ANS**:The software development life cycle is a step by step method used to create softwares and involves planning, designing, developing, testing, deployment and maintaining of the software from initial development to deployment. The SDLC involves processes like the waterfall method, agile method and scrum from which developers can choose to use as a means to step by step design a software.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase: 
**ANS** 
- WATERFALL METHOD: This methods follows linear sequential steps from initiation to deployment (finish).
- AGILE METHOD: This methods follows a more flexible, repetitive cycle that enables incremental development 
                depending on the challenges and changes that can be faced during the development.
- SCRUM: This is an agile derived method that involves creating of teams to define roles and enable short 
         repetitions called sprints.
        
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
**ANS**: 
- Agile involves a more flexible repetitive method while Waterfall model involves a sequential non repetitive step by step method to develop softwares.
- Agile enables adaptability during development while the waterfall model cannot easily be adaptable.
- Agile model gives room from changes to be made in case the client would like to change somthing, this doesn't affect the entire developement model as it is flexible while when using the waterfall model, changes can affect the entire model.
- Agile model focuses on small individual parts of the development process while Waterfall model focuses on the entire wholesome of the development model.
- 
Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
**ANS**: Requirements engineering is a process used to determine how and what a software system should do and document these clearly and accurately. The process involved includes:
  - information gatherinng: Gathering of the requirements from the client or stakeholders via data collection methods like interviews or surveys.
  - Requirements analysis: refining the requirements in order to create a clear developement roadmap to follow to meet these objectives.
  - Specifications: This is where the requirements are placed in a document after being refined.
  - Requirements Validation: This ensures that the needs or requirements of the stakeholders are accurately met by checking whether the process in the specifications document was followed properly.
  - Tracking and Managing changes: This enables the tracking and management of any changes made to the stakeholders requirements throughout the course of project developement. 

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? 
**ANS**: Modularity is the practice of dividing a software system into separate, independent parts called modules; where each module has a specific function and can be developed, tested and maintained independently without affecting the rest of the system. Modularity improves maintainability and scalability by enabling changes and fixes to be made independently from the entire system thus updates and debuging the software is much easier. Furthermore, it enhances scalability by enabling new features to be added as new modules thus minimizing the impact on the entire system.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). 
**ANS**: 
- Unit Testing: This is the testing of the software components in individual components called modules to ensure that the modules are working as required.
- Integration Testing: This is the interaction testing to see how the software can interact with other systems, thereby ensuring that different modules and services used by the software work effectively together.
- System Testing: Is the test used to validate that the software is complete and integrated properly to ensure that the quality requirements have not been compromised.
- Acceptance Testing: This type of test is conducted or carried out by the client or stakeholder to ensure that their needs and requirements have been met, thus calling it the grandfinale phase before the software is deployed as a live system.
  
Why is testing crucial in software development? **ANS**: It is crucial because it ensures quality standards are met, validation requirements have met the specified requirements and enhances reliability by increasing the confidence in the softwares performance and stability.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
**ANS**:
- VCS are platforms use to track and manage or commit changes to software code, allowing multiple developers the opportunity to collaboratively work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each others work. The version control systems are important because they create room for collaboration, history tracking, and allows developers to independently work on new features via branches and then merge them in the main project repository via the branching and merging git command.
- Examples include: Git - has the branching and merging, distributed version control and github integration feature for collaboration.
                   Subversion - Which is a centralized version control system with features like directory versioning and commits.
  
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
